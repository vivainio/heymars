# Heymars quick primer

You ended up here because you clicked "help" button in Heymars. Welcome! Heymars is operated by keyboard. Here are the commands you can use:

| Key | Operation |
| --- | --- |
| Enter | Launch command on current line |
| Space | Launch command on current line, capture output, show it in Visual Studio Code |
| Backspace | Kill process on current line
| F5 | Reload the configuration file (e.g. after editing it) |

## UI buttons (advanced)

| Button | Operation | 
| --- | --- |
| Log | Start capturing all output to log. Press again to stop logging and show the captured log in VSCode | 
| Output | Start capturing output. When you focus a new line, the current log is shown in a separate window | 
| Cls | "Clear Screen". Delete all old statuses from status columns | 
| Speak | Enable this to turn on speech synthesizer. It tells when a process has been completed when Heymars is not on the foreground. Handy for long lasting build commands! |
